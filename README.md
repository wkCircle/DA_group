## Self-access Data Analysis Study Group
Welcome to our study group! Our main purpose is to learn together and share knowledge of data analysis wihtin members. <br />
We'll have different topics each week. Every member take turns to be a speaker at a certain week. <br />
To see our weekly topics, please scroll down and refer to the `Weekly Materials List` section. <br />
Notice that the hyperlinks listed in that section won't guid you to the corresponding folder but external relevant websties. <br />
Any corrections and suggestions are wellcomed from any readers! <br />

## Environment
Environment requirement may differ according to different topics each week. <br />
However, `python3.5` or above and `jupyter notebook` are a must since our main compiling language is python saved as `.ipynb` files.
